# Who I am?

Hello, I'm a self-taught person who's is always ready to learn new things. I do have knowledge of Digital Advertising. I'm currently dedicated to creating content about advertising and marketing digital for indie video game developers. I like communicating with other people about the new technologies so far, so we can be updated.

Video games have been in my life for a long time, that is the reason I want help with my digital marketing skills to grow the video game industry. I know that digital marketing is a fundamental piece.

# Specialities

Google ads, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, Twitter ads, copywriting, planner, Google Analytics and Google Data Studio.

# Trajectory

Right now I'm an advertiser junior, but I have able to participate in a contest, where I put myself to demonstrate my teamwork skills and knowledge, Finally, we got a special mention from the judges. They said, " They did a process very complete, a strategy very achievable and according to the judge, it can be started".

Also, I've helped organize the marketing and advertising strategy of Mapri. Mapri is a project that aims to publicize African and Afro-descendant culture, through the sale of headscarf.
