# Who I am?

Hello,  I'm a self-taught person who's is always ready to learn new things. I do have knowledge of Digital Advertising. I'm currently dedicated to creating content about advertising and marketing digital for indie video game developers, eCommerce and EdTech. I like communicating with other people about the new technologies so far, so we can be updated.



# Specialities

Google ads, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, Twitter ads, copywriting, planner, Google Analytics and Google Data Studio, BI Excel, Power BI and Automation tools for marketing.

# Trajectory

At 17 years old my self-learning began, where I first focused on learning canine psychology, then my entrepreneurial mind was awakened and I started educating many people about dogs. From that experience and Platzi, I saw the great potential that EdTech has.

Right now I'm an advertiser junior, but I have able to participate in a contest, where I put myself to demonstrate my teamwork skills and knowledge, Finally, we got a special mention from the judges. They said, " They did a process very complete, a strategy very achievable and
according to the judge, it can be started" ( *you can see this project on my portfolio*).

Also, I've helped organize the marketing and advertising strategy of Mapri. Mapri is a project that aims to publicize African and Afro-descendant culture, through the sale of headscarf.

# Recent project

I made an eCommerce store with the help of Woocommerce for Mapri and in this way, I have strengthened my Digital Marketing skills in that industry.


Video Games have been in my life for a long time, that is the reason I want help with my digital marketing skills to grow the video game industry.
