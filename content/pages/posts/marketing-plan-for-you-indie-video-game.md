A marketing plan can be very helpful in starting and launching your video game, but, what's a marketing plan?. It's a roadmap that you will guide through the communication process and must answer two basic questions: **What are you going to sell? How are you going to sell?.**

If you're able to create your own indie video game with your feeling, knowledge, imagination and creativity, those characteristics could match many people, but, you have to understand who's your target audience.

Your target audience at the beginning of development can be a valuable companion because it will guide the success of your video game. The more you know and attract the right people, the more effective the feedback will be and ensure a happy ending launch. Remember that at this point, **the customer wants to be heard and that's always the case in any healthy relationship**.

Therefore, you should start your marketing plan with the following topics:

*   *Current situation of your video game*

*   *SWOT matrix*

*   *Brand positioning*

*   *Branding build*

*   *Define the customer's profile*

*   *Customer journey*

*   *SMART goals*

*   *Value proposal*

*   *Define communication channels*

*   *Content strategies*

*   *Possible advertising campaigns*

In the next few articles, I'll talk in more depth about each of the topics. **Have you applied these methods to your indie video game? let me know in the <a class="event-url" href="https://www.ivandemartino.com/contact/" target="_blank"><strong>contacts</strong></a> section.**
