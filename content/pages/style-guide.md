I participated in a contest at Platzi, where I had to digitize a real restaurant. I worked as a team with Mara Maiguel Prince and we got a special mention.

My tasks were:

- Outbound Specialist.
- Planner.
- Content writing and copywriting.
- Implementation of campaigns on platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, Youtube Ads.
